# rust-practice
A collection of small Rust programs I'm writing to learn and practice the language.

## Contents
- `hello_world`: The classic "Hello, world!" program implemented in Rust (this is the default output of `cargo new`).
- `guessing_game`: The guessing game sample project from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) ebook.
